        <h2> Web Security</h2>
        <p> id="web-security-question" How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word you count for your answer should not be grater than 250 words</p>
    <p> id="web-security-answer" I would advise the client to have a secure network that is password protected i would also recomend anti-virus protection containing firewall of some sorts even most of them do, i would also advise my client to set up a two-factor or multi-factor authentication for logins like bankid or Onelogin,i would recomend atomatic user time-out for the client and suggest a onboarding proscess for the client to ensure safe use.</p>
