    <p> web-security-answer: I would advise the client to have a secure network that is password protected with advanced passwords. I would also recomend upto date security software, i would also advise my client to set up a two-factor or multi-factor authentication for any logins like bankid or Onelogin to make sure the clients information is protected ,i would also recomend atomatic user time-out for the client and suggest a onboarding proscess for the client to ensure safe usage.</p>
