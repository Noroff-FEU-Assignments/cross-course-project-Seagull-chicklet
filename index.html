    <p> web-security-answer:</p> 
    <p>I would advise the client to have a secure network that is password protected with advanced passwords, and that is not your birthday or home adress get into it and be creative then you make it hard or even impossible to guess for an outsider. I would also recomend up to date security software there are a lot of software to choose from but any recently updated software will be sufficient, i would also advise my client to set up a two-factor or multi-factor authentication for any logins like bankid or Onelogin to make sure the clients sensitive information is protected, i would also recomend atomatic user time-out for the client, if you get distractet form your workplace it will guard your information if you leave it unattended and last i suggest a onboarding proscess for the client to ensure safe usage.</p>
     <h3>Best of luck in to your web journey</h3>
